## Toggle Project

A simple interactive web page that demonstrates toggling a CSS class using JavaScript.

### Features
- Click the "Click Here!" text to toggle its style (color, background, padding, alignment).
- Uses vanilla JavaScript and CSS for interactivity and styling.

### How It Works
- The text with id `hello` is clickable.
- When clicked, it toggles the `.name` class, changing its appearance.
- The `.name` class is defined in `style.css`.
- All logic is handled in `main.js`.
